# reactTDDPractice

**React, Jest, and Enzyme**

In this project I will be practicing:

- Use TDD to develop a React Application
- Test a React Application with Enzyme and Jest
- Write and use CSS variables for reuse and responsive design
- Create a reusable React component that renders and functions differently based on the provided props
- Use React propTypes to type check component props
- Approach an application from a responsive design perspective
- Use the Flexible Box Module to create a flexible layout

**Process of Test-Drive Development**

Test-driven development (TDD) is a development method that utilizes repetition of a short development cycle (red-green-refactor).

#### Process:

1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails (red)
3. Write the code to pass the test (green)
4. Run all tests
5. Refactor
6. Repeat

#### Pros:

1. Design before implementation
2. Helps prevent future regressions and bugs
3. Increases confidence that the code works as expected

#### Cons:

1. Takes longer to develop (but it can save time in the long run)
2. Testing edge cases is hard
3. Mocking/faking/stubbing is even harder
